I am currently a postdoc at [http://theory.stanford.edu/main/index.shtml Stanford University, Department of Computer Science] (theory group), where I am fortunate to be primarily mentored by [http://web.stanford.edu/~saberi/ Prof. Amin Saberi], and jointly by [http://theory.stanford.edu/~tim/ Prof. Tim Roughgarden] and [https://profiles.stanford.edu/moses-charikar Prof. Moses Charikar]. Prior to Stanford, I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science (minored in Applied Mathematics) from [http://www.cs.cornell.edu/ Cornell University], where I was thrilled to be advised by [https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~rdk/ Prof. Robert Kleinberg]. 

I study the interplay between algorithms, incentives, and learning, with a focus on applications in /revenue management/, /market design/ and /digital economy/. Topics include:\n
- Algorithmic mechanism design and game theory,
- Online learning theory and applications,
- Online, stochastic and non-convex optimization,
- Algorithmic aspects of machine learning.

Here are the links to my [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8sKIuAcAAAAJ&hl=en Google scholar page], my [https://cs.stanford.edu/~rad/cv-radniazadeh.pdf CV] and a [https://cs.stanford.edu/~rad/bio.html short Bio/highlights].\n\n

- *I will be joining [https://www.chicagobooth.edu/ University of Chicago, Booth School of Business,] as Assistant Professor of Operations Management in July 2020!* 
- *I will be joining [https://ai.google/research/teams/algorithms-optimization/ Google Research NYC] as a visiting researcher/faculty in December 2019!*
