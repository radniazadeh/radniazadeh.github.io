I am a theory postdoc at [http://theory.stanford.edu/main/index.shtml Stanford University, Department of Computer Science], where I am fortunate to be primarily mentored by [http://web.stanford.edu/~saberi/ Prof. Amin Saberi], and to be closely working/hosted by [http://theory.stanford.edu/~tim/ Prof. Tim Roughgarden] and [https://profiles.stanford.edu/moses-charikar Prof. Moses Charikar]. Prior to Stanford, I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science (minored in Applied Mathematics) from [http://www.cs.cornell.edu/ Cornell University], where I was thrilled to be advised by [https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~rdk/ Prof. Robert Kleinberg]. During my career so far, I have been awarded the [https://connect.informs.org/rmp/awards/dissertation-award INFORMS Revenue Management & Pricing Dissertation Award (Honorable Mention)], [http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2016/03/announcing-2016-google-phd-fellows-for.html Google Ph.D. Fellowship (market algorithms)], [http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2006/11/alumni-irwin-and-joan-jacobs-give-30-million-gift Jacobs Scholar Fellowship (Cornell)] and [https://windowsontheory.org/2016/12/25/motwani-postdoctoral-fellowship-at-stanford/ Motwani Fellowship (Stanford)]. I was also a research intern at [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/theory-group/ Microsoft Research (Redmond)], [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-england/ Microsoft Research (New England)] and [https://research.yahoo.com/ Yahoo! Research]. \n


 *I am on the academic job market this year (CS\/Business Schools\/OR)!*

== Research Interests

I am broadly interested in algorithms, game theory and machine learning, with a focus on applications in /market design/ and /revenue management/:\n
- Algorithmic mechanism design,
- Structured online learning and applications in designing online marketplaces,
- Algorithmic aspects of machine learning,
- Online, stochastic and non-convex optimization.

 Here are the links to my [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8sKIuAcAAAAJ&hl=en Google scholar page], my [https://cs.stanford.edu/~rad/cv-radniazadeh.pdf CV] and a [https://cs.stanford.edu/~rad/bio.html short Bio].
