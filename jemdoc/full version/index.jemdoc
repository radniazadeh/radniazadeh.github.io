== Biography
My name is  Rad Niazadeh (راد نیازاده), and I did my Ph.D. in theoretical computer science at [http://www.cs.cornell.edu/ *Cornell University*] in 2017. I have been thrilled to have professor [https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~rdk/ *Robert Kleinberg*] as my advisor at Cornell. Prior to that, I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering form [http://ee.sharif.ir/ Sharif University of Technology] in 2008 and 2010 respectively. I will start as a “Motwani postdoctoral researcher” at [http://theory.stanford.edu/main/index.shtml *Stanford University*] (computer science department, theory group) in Fall 2017. Joint with Stanford, I will also be a long-term visiting scientist at [https://simons.berkeley.edu/people/rad-niazadeh Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at UC Berkeley] during Fall 2017. Here are the links to my [http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~rad/cv-rad.pdf CV] and [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8sKIuAcAAAAJ&hl=en Google scholar page].




- /On a separate note:/ my better half, /Saba Niaki/, is a graphic designer and is looking for jobs in the Bay Area. Check her well-designed [https://www.sabaniaki.com/ homepage]!

== Research Interests

My current interests are in different areas of /theoretical computer science/ and /operations research/, with a focus on *“economics and computation”*: 
~~~
- Algorithmic mechanism design, 
- Online algorithms and mechanisms,
- Learning in mechanisms and markets,
- Computational social choice.
~~~

Problems at the intersection of /combinatorial optimization/, /game theory/, /machine learning/ and /probability theory/ are of my general interest.
== Research Internships

During several internships, I had the great privilege of being mentored by:

- [http://www.nikhildevanur.com/ *Nikhil Devanur*] at [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/theory-group/ *Microsoft Research (Redmond)*] in Summer 2016, 
- [http://www.immorlica.com/ *Nicole Immorlica*] and [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/brlucier/ *Brendan Lucier*] at [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-england/ *Microsoft Research (New England)*] in Summer 2015,
- [https://research.yahoo.com/researchers/cwilkens *Chris Wilkens*] at [https://research.yahoo.com/ *Yahoo! Research*] in Fall 2015.

== Honor and Awards
